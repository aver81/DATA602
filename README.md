This is a GitHub pages site for the Aayush Verma's DATA602 repo.
The repo contains three files:
  1. Why_interested.txt file    (here I answered why I took up the course DATA602)
  2. .gitignore file            (file created to prevent the data.DAT from being pushed from                                       local to Github repo)
  3. README.md                (this file was created to serve as the display for the GitHub pages                                 website)
